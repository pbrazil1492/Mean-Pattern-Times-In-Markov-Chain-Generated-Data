# Mean-Pattern-Times-In-Markov-Chain-Generated-Data
In Ross's 11th Edition of "Introduction to Probability Models" there is a section titled "Example 4.26 (Mean Pattern Times In Markov Chain Generated Data)". This section concerns Markov chains and the problem of finding the mean time spent waiting for a specific sequence of states to appear. Ross's argument includes an algorithm for a closed-form solution for said problem. This program performs the algorithm on a predetermined Markov chain and pattern (the Markov chain and pattern chosen is quite arbitrary and can be altered)
